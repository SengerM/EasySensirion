# Code from Sensirion https://github.com/Sensirion/python-i2c-sht

class SensirionSensor:
	"""
	This class was created to wrap and ease the use of the example in this link: https://sensirion.github.io/python-i2c-sht/quickstart.html. It is to be used to control one SHT3x [1] sensor connected to a SEK Sensor Bridge [2]. For this to work, connect the sensor to the "port 1" in the sensor bridge and then the sensor bridge with the USB to the computer.

	NOTE: Before I was able to make this work, I had to open the graphical interface downloadable here https://www.sensirion.com/en/controlcenter/ and after this the computer was able to "detect" the `\dev\ttyUSB0`. I think it is a permission issue which is automatically solved by their software."""
